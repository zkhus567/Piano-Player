/**
 * 
 * <p>Container to encapsulate all of the somewhat messy parts of the
 * JavaSound system. It provides a fairly clean interface to let you
 * add and play notes using the MIDI sequencer.</p> 
 * 
 * <p>MIDI has two tools, one is the sequencer and one is the synthesizer.
 * The synthesizer allows you to modify various waves to produce sounds,
 * and is beyond what we need here. The sequencer is based around a 
 * series of messages telling it what to do.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This class wraps contains all of the messages, and adds new
 * messages only when asked by the methods.</p>
 * 
 * <p><b>NOTE</b>: Currently the class cannot stop playing notes even after
 * it has finished playing all messages, so you must manually stop
 * the program running after playing.
 *  - If possible a less broken version 2 will be distributed when
 *  there's a moment.</p>
